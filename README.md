# Alabama Prison Data

## Data
The attached csv file "facility_operations_2010_to_2020.csv" contains prison population, assaults and deaths data from the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC). The csv file was constructed using data pulled from ADOC's September monthly statistical reports for the years 2010-2020. See page four of these documents for the exact values in the "Facility Operations" table. Each row in the csv file coresponds to a row in the page four table for a given year. These files are available in pdf form only on ADOC's statistical reports webpage: http://www.doc.state.al.us/StatReports.
