# AL_Prison_Data

The attached csv file "facility_operations_2010_to_2018.csv" contains prison population, assaults and deaths data from the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC). The csv file was constructed using data pulled from ADOC's September monthly statistical reports for the years 2010-2018. See page four of these documents for the exact values in the "Facility Operations" table. Each row in the csv file coresponds to a row in the page four table for a given year. These files are available in pdf form only on ADOC's statistical reports webpage: http://www.doc.state.al.us/StatReports.

### Notes
The *facility.type* variable abbreviations stand for the following:
- CLOSE = Close Security
- MED = Medium Security
- MIN = Minimum Security
- MIN WC = Minimum Security Work Center
- MIN WR = Minimum Security Work Release
